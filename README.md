## Features

- **Responsive Front-End:** Developed with React for a seamless user experience.
- **Firebase Integration:** Connects to Firebase for authentication, real-time database, and more.
- **Custom API Server:** An Express server handles additional backend processes.
- **Future ML Integration:** Planned support for machine learning models to enhance the hiring process.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) (for Firebase related tasks)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FaceHire.git
   cd FaceHire
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   - **For the UI App:**

     ```bash
     cd facehire_ui
     npm install
     cd ..
     ```

   - **For the Express Server:**

     ```bash
     cd firebase_external
     npm install
     cd ..
     ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Sensitive data like API keys and Firebase secrets are excluded from version control. To set up your local environment, do the following:

   - **For the Express Server:**
     
     Create a `.env` file in the `firebase_external` folder:
     
     ```env
     FIREBASE_SECRET=your_firebase_secret_here
     ```
     
   - **For the UI App:**
     
     Consider using environment variables as per Create React App guidelines. You can create a `.env` file with keys prefixed by `REACT_APP_`.

   *Optional:* Provide sample configuration files like `.env.example` or `firebase.example.js` for guidance.

4. **Running the Project:**

   - **Start the UI App:**

     ```bash
     cd facehire_ui
     npm start
     ```
     
   - **Start the Express Server:**

     ```bash
     cd firebase_external
     npm start
     ```

## Configuration Details

- **Sensitive Files:**  
  Files such as `firebase.json`, `serviceAccountKey.json`, and `facehire_ui/src/firebase.js` (which contains your Firebase API key) are excluded via the `.gitignore` file. Use sample files (`firebase.example.js`, `.env.example`) for guidance.
